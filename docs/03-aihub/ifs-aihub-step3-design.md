# Step 3: Design

**📊 Progress:** Step 3 of 4
**⏱️ Estimated Time:** 5-6 hours

## Executive Summary
This step represents the core architecture work for the AI Hub solution. You'll create a comprehensive technical design that addresses IFS's requirements while following Azure best practices for secure, scalable AI platforms. Your design will establish a central foundation for accelerating AI innovation across the organization.

## 📝 Activities

- Review your findings from Steps 1 and 2.
- As a team, design and document:
  1. **Architecture:** Draw a high-level architecture diagram showing the AI Hub architecture.
  2. **Service Selection:** List Azure services that will be part of the AI Hub.
  3. **Network Security:** Detail the network design including VNets, subnets, NSGs, and private endpoints.
  4. **Identity & Access:** Define the identity model, service principals, managed identities, and RBAC.
  5. **Cost Controls:** Design the approach for cost tagging, budgets, and alerts.
  6. **Monitoring & Operations:** Design the monitoring strategy, logs, and alerts.
  7. **Resource Management:** Define the resource group structure, tagging strategy, and governance controls.

## Guidance

> **Best Practice:** Reference the [Azure OpenAI baseline Landing Zone reference architecture](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/ai-ml/architecture/azure-openai-baseline-landing-zone) and apply these principles to your broader AI Hub design.
>
> - Incorporate architectural patterns from [Azure Architecture Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/).
> - Apply the [Well-Architected Framework](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/framework/) pillars.
> - Consider use of Infrastructure as Code (Bicep/ARM/Terraform) for deployment.

## Success Criteria ✅

By the end of this step, you should have:
- ✓ A comprehensive AI Hub architecture diagram
- ✓ Clear rationale for Azure service selections
- ✓ Documentation of network, identity, cost, and operational controls
- ✓ A governance model that meets IFS requirements

To successfully complete this step, your design should provide a complete technical blueprint for implementing the AI Hub that addresses all requirements identified in the previous step.
