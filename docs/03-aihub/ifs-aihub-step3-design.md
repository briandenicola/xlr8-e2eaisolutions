# Step 3: Design

This section is part of the **IFS AI Hub Challenge**. Here, you’ll design the end-to-end architecture for the AI Hub, ensuring alignment with Azure best practices and reference architectures.

---

## Objective

Define the architecture, controls, and Azure services needed for a robust, secure, and scalable AI Hub solution.

---

## Activities

- Review your requirements from Step 2.
- As a team, design and document:
  1. **Architecture Diagram:** Sketch a high-level diagram of the AI Hub (shared services, networking, identity, security, monitoring, etc.)
  2. **Azure Services:** List and justify the core Azure services and controls you will use (e.g., API Management, OpenAI, AI Search, Key Vault, Log Analytics).
  3. **Security & Governance:** Describe how you will enforce governance, compliance, and security (e.g., policies, private endpoints, managed identities).
  4. **Operational Readiness:** Outline how you will monitor, manage, and support the environment.
  5. **Scalability & Connectivity:** How will you support multiple workloads and secure cross-environment connectivity?
  6. **Deployment:** How will you use IaC and CI/CD to automate deployment and updates?

## Guidance

> **Reference:** [Azure OpenAI baseline Landing Zone reference architecture](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/ai-ml/architecture/azure-openai-baseline-landing-zone) and [Azure Best Practices](../05-azure-best-practices/)
>
> - Use diagrams and tables to clarify your design.
> - Justify your Azure service choices based on requirements and best practices.
> - Consider both current and future needs for scalability and governance.

---

## Success Criteria

By the end of this step, you should have:
- Presented a clear architecture diagram with all major components and Azure services
- Justified your service selection and design decisions
- Described your approach to security, governance, and operational excellence
- Outlined your deployment and monitoring strategy
