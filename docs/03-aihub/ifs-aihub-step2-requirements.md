# Step 2: Requirements

This section is part of the **IFS AI Hub Challenge**. Here, you’ll identify and document the business, technical, and governance requirements for a centralized AI Hub.

---

## Objective

Capture all critical requirements—network, access, secrets, monitoring, governance, and scalability—that must be addressed in your solution.

---

## Activities

- Review your findings from Step 1 (Scenario).
- As a team, discuss and document:
  1. **Network Isolation:** What are the requirements for private endpoints, VNet integration, and secure cross-VNet connectivity?
  2. **Access Control:** What are the requirements for secure gateways, authentication, authorization, and traffic management?
  3. **Secrets Management:** What are the requirements for centralized secret storage, secure access, rotation, and auditing?
  4. **Monitoring & Logging:** What are the requirements for logging, monitoring, usage tracking, and security event alerting?
  5. **Governance:** What are the requirements for policy enforcement, resource management, compliance, and cost control?
  6. **Scalability:** What are the requirements for supporting multiple workloads and onboarding new services?

## Guidance

> **Best Practice:** Reference the [Azure Best Practices](../05-azure-best-practices/) and [Azure OpenAI baseline Landing Zone reference architecture](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/ai-ml/architecture/azure-openai-baseline-landing-zone) for security, governance, and operational recommendations.
>
> - Use bullet points or tables for clarity.
> - Prioritize requirements as "Must Have" or "Nice to Have".
> - Consider both current and future needs.

---

## Success Criteria

By the end of this step, you should have:
- Documented requirements for each major area (network, access, secrets, monitoring, governance, scalability)
- Prioritized requirements and aligned them with business needs
- Ensured requirements reflect lessons learned from the RAG chatbot implementation
