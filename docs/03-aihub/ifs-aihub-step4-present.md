# Step 4: Present & Justify

This section is part of the **IFS AI Hub Challenge**. Here, you'll present your AI Hub solution and justify your design decisions to the group.

---

## Objective

Communicate your design clearly, explain your choices, and demonstrate how your solution meets IFS's business and technical requirements while showcasing ROI and strategic alignment.

---

## Mandatory Presentation Activities

Your presentation must cover all areas below to receive approval for implementation:

### Core Presentation Structure (10-15 minutes)

1. **Business Case & Value Proposition (2-3 min)**
   - Quantified business outcomes and ROI projections

   - Risk mitigation through centralized AI governance

2. **Requirements Validation (2-3 min)**
   - How each critical requirement is addressed
   - Trade-offs made and rationale
   - Compliance and security posture

3. **AI Hub Architecture (4-5 min)**
   - Core architecture diagram with data flow
   - Service selection justification
   - Scalability and extensibility design
   - Integration with existing Azure Landing Zones

4. **Implementation Roadmap (2-3 min)**
   - Phased deployment approach
   - Resource requirements and timeline
   - Success metrics and monitoring strategy

5. **Risk Assessment & Mitigation (1-2 min)**
