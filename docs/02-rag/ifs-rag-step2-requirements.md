# Step 2: Requirements

This section is part of the **IFS RAG Challenge**. Here, you’ll identify and document the business and technical requirements for the IFS Knowledge Assistant chatbot.

---

## Objective

Capture all critical requirements—business, technical, security, compliance, and operational—that must be addressed in your solution.

---

## Activities

- Review your findings from Step 1 (Scenario).
- As a team, discuss and document:
  1. **Business Requirements:** What must the solution achieve for IFS to consider it a success?
  2. **Technical Requirements:** What are the key technical needs?
  3. **Security & Compliance:** What security, privacy, and compliance standards must be met?
  4. **Operational Requirements:** What are the support, monitoring, and management needs?

---

## Guidance

> **Best Practice:** Reference the [Azure Best Practices](../05-azure-best-practices/) and [Baseline OpenAI E2E Chat reference architecture](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/ai-ml/architecture/baseline-openai-e2e-chat) for security, governance, and operational recommendations.
> 
> - Use bullet points for clarity.
> - Prioritize requirements as "Must Have" or "Nice to Have".
> - Consider both current and future needs.

**Example Table:**

| Requirement Type | Description | Priority |
