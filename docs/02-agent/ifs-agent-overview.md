- [Next: Step 1 - Principles ➡️](./ifs-agent-step1-principles.md)

Welcome to the **IFS AI Agent Challenge**. This challenge guides you through designing, deploying, and operationalizing an internal AI workload using Agentic AI principles, building on the foundation established in the AI Ready Challenge.

---

## Prerequisites

Before starting this challenge, ensure you have:

- **Completed AI Ready Challenge** with selected use cases and prioritized business outcomes
- **Azure Landing Zone foundation** established from Challenge 1
- **Access to internal stakeholders** for use case validation and requirements gathering
- **One selected use case** from the AI Ready Challenge for detailed implementation

## Challenge Context

**Internal Use Case Focus:** This workload addresses an internal use case within IFS, serving as a learning journey to build expertise with Azure AI before customer-facing engagements.

**Risk Minimization & Compliance:** Internal deployment provides a low-risk, low-regulatory path to AI innovation while building team confidence and readiness across organizations.

**Productivity Focus:** Generative AI serves as a productivity accelerator, augmenting internal users to work faster and smarter with intelligent automation.

**Agentic AI Principles:** Solutions must incorporate:
- **Automated collections of tasks** that work together seamlessly
- **Operation with or without human supervision** based on context and requirements
- **Agent-to-agent collaboration capabilities** enabling intelligent coordination
- **Chained processes** creating cohesive, intelligent systems that deliver business value

### Your Role in the Journey

In this **AI Agent Challenge**, you'll build upon the AI foundation established in the first challenge:

1. **Building on the Foundation**: You'll deploy the RAG chatbot into the secure Azure Landing Zone created in Challenge 1
2. **Proves the Concept**: Your functional agent application demonstrates the practical value of the AI infrastructure
3. **Reveals Scaling Needs**: The lessons learned will directly inform the centralized AI Hub design in Challenge 3

```

**Progressive AI Journey:**
1. [**AI Ready Challenge ←**](../../ai-ready-challenge.md) - Established the secure Azure foundation that this challenge builds upon
2. **AI Agent Challenge (Current)** - Builds an internal RAG chatbot on the foundation
3. [**AI Hub Challenge →**](../../ai-hub-challenge.md) - Will create a centralized AI management platform based on lessons learned here

This challenge leverages the Azure Landing Zone created in the AI Ready Challenge as its foundation, ensuring security and governance while focusing on application functionality.

## Challenge Objectives

- Select and refine one AI use case from the AI Ready Challenge for internal deployment
- Design an Agentic AI solution that automates collections of tasks and processes
- Enable agent-to-agent collaboration and intelligent process chaining
- Focus on productivity acceleration for internal users and teams
- Integrate seamlessly with the Azure Landing Zone foundation from Challenge 1
- Plan and design Day 2 operations including monitoring, scaling, and governance

---

## Challenge Structure

This challenge is divided into six steps:

1. [Step 1: Agentic AI Principles & Patterns](./ifs-agent-step1-principles.md) – Learn foundational concepts and Azure multi-agent architecture patterns
2. [Step 2: Functional Requirements](./ifs-agent-step2-functional-requirements.md) – Capture intended capabilities and behaviors of the AI workload
3. [Step 3: Non-Functional Requirements](./ifs-agent-step3-nonfunctional-requirements.md) – Document scalability, performance, security, and compliance attributes
4. [Step 4: Solution Design](./ifs-agent-step4-solution-design.md) – Create workload architecture with Agentic AI patterns
5. [Step 5: Integration](./ifs-agent-step5-integration.md) – Deploy into Azure Landing Zone with Day 2 operations
6. [Step 6: Presentation](./ifs-agent-step6-presentation.md) – Share journey from use case to deployment and operations
