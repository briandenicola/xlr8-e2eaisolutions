## 📝 Activities

- Review your findings from Step 2 (Functional Requirements).
- As a team, discuss and document:
  1. **🏆 Business Requirements:** What must the solution achieve for IFS to consider it a success?
  2. **⚙️ Technical Requirements:** What are the key technical needs?
  3. **🛡️ Security & Compliance:** What security, privacy, and compliance standards must be met?
  4. **Operational Requirements:** What are the support, monitoring, and management needs?

## Guidance

### Business Requirements

Consider aspects like:

1. **Cost Efficiency and ROI:**
   - Implementation costs should be offset by productivity gains within 12 months
   - Reduced time spent searching for information (target: 30% reduction)
   - Integration with existing IT investments to minimize additional expenditure

2. **User Adoption and Experience:**
   - Interface must be intuitive with minimal training needed
   - Response time must be under 3 seconds for standard queries
   - Accuracy rate of 90%+ for responses with high confidence scores

3. **Scalability and Growth:**
   - Support for 5,000+ global employees
   - Ability to expand knowledge domains without architecture redesign
   - Multi-language support (English initial phase, expansion later)
