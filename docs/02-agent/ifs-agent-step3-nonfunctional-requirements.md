This section is part of the **IFS AI Agent Challenge**. Here, you'll identify and document the business and technical requirements for the IFS Knowledge Assistant chatbot.

---

## Objective

Capture all critical requirements—business, technical, security, compliance, and operational—that must be addressed in your solution.

---

## Activities

- Review your findings from Step 2 (Functional Requirements).
- As a team, discuss and document:
  1. **Business Requirements:** What must the solution achieve for IFS to consider it a success?
  2. **Technical Requirements:** What are the key technical needs?
  3. **Security & Compliance:** What security, privacy, and compliance standards must be met?
  4. **Operational Requirements:** What are the support, monitoring, and management needs?
