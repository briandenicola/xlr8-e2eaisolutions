## 🧰 Prerequisites

> [!NOTE]
> This step requires collaborative input from multiple teams. Schedule your design workshops in advance to ensure all key stakeholders can participate.

What you need before starting:

- **2-3 collaborative workshop sessions** (most teams complete this in 1-2 weeks)
- **Key team representatives** available for design discussions
- **Basic understanding of current Azure setup** (if any exists)
- **Requirements from Step 2** as input for design decisions

[🔝 Back to Top](#step-3-ai-platform-design)
- **Access to architecture documentation** (if available)

## Cross-Challenge Connection

> [!TIP]
> The Azure Landing Zone you design here will be the foundation for the AI applications in later challenges.

The AI foundation you design in this step will directly support:
- The RAG chatbot deployment in [AI Agent Challenge - Solution Design](../../02-agent/ifs-agent-step4-solution-design.md)
- The centralized AI services in [AI Hub Challenge - Design](../../03-aihub/ifs-aihub-step3-design.md)

Design your landing zones with these future workloads in mind!

## Why Azure Landing Zones Are Essential

**Azure Landing Zones provide the foundation for successful AI initiatives.** Organizations with proper ALZ foundations experience:

- **70% faster AI deployments** with standardized patterns and automation
- **Reduced operational complexity** through consistent governance and monitoring
- **Built-in compliance** that prevents common regulatory issues
- **Team productivity gains** from self-service capabilities with guardrails
- **Cost optimization** through automated governance and resource management

### Success Stories

Teams using ALZ consistently report:
- "Deployment time reduced from weeks to days"
- "No more late-night troubleshooting calls"
- "Compliance audits became routine instead of stressful"
- "Developers can focus on AI innovation instead of infrastructure"

### Value by Team (Positive Outcomes)

| Team | How ALZ Helps | Typical Results |
|------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Network Team** | Standardized patterns, centralized control, predictable topology | 60% less manual configuration, consistent connectivity |
| **Security Team** | Built-in zero-trust, automated compliance, centralized monitoring | Automated compliance reporting, proactive threat detection |
| **Infrastructure Team** | Self-service with guardrails, standardization, automation | 70% faster deployments, reduced manual tasks |
| **Development Team** | Rapid provisioning, consistent environments | Focus on code instead of infrastructure, faster time-to-market |
| **Data Team** | Built-in data governance, automated classification | Data quality improvements, compliance by design |
| **AI Team** | Pre-configured AI services, embedded responsible AI | Accelerated AI adoption, ethical AI by default |

### Essential Foundation Components

> [!WARNING]
> Skipping or bypassing the Azure Landing Zone components below can lead to significant security vulnerabilities, compliance gaps, and operational challenges that are costly and time-consuming to remediate later.

The following ALZ components are **foundational** for IFS AI success:

✅ **Management Group hierarchy** with policy inheritance  
✅ **Azure Policy baselines** for compliance automation  
✅ **Hub-spoke network topology** with private endpoints  
✅ **Identity governance** with least-privilege access  
✅ **Monitoring and alerting** for operational excellence  
✅ **Resource organization** with consistent naming and tagging  

#### Example Azure Policy Definition for AI Workloads

```json
{
  "properties": {
    "displayName": "Deny OpenAI deployments without private endpoints",
    "description": "This policy ensures that all Azure OpenAI deployments use private endpoints for secure access",
    "mode": "All",
    "parameters": {},
    "policyRule": {
      "if": {
        "allOf": [
          {
            "field": "type",
            "equals": "Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts"
          },
          {
            "field": "Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts/kind",
            "equals": "OpenAI"
          },
          {
            "field": "Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts/properties.publicNetworkAccess",
            "notEquals": "Disabled"
          }
        ]
      },
      "then": {
        "effect": "deny"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Objective

Define a scalable, secure, and governed AI Ready Azure Landing Zone architecture by:
- Structuring management groups and subscriptions (platform vs application zones)
- Applying Azure Policy baselines for regulatory and compliance requirements
- Designing network topology and connectivity controls
- Establishing identity, access, and resource organization strategies
- Planning operational readiness (monitoring, management, and governance)

---

## Collaborative Design Activities

**Teams work together** to design the ALZ foundation that supports everyone's needs. This collaborative approach ensures successful AI deployment.

> [!TIP]
> Use a visual collaboration tool like Microsoft Whiteboard or Miro for the design sessions to make it easier for remote participants to contribute effectively.

  2. **Subscription Strategy Planning:**
     - Map services and workloads to appropriate subscriptions collaboratively
     - **Team validation:** All teams confirm their workload placement makes sense

**Session 2: Governance & Security (2 hours)**
  
  3. **Policy Baselines Selection:**
     - Choose built-in and custom Azure Policy definitions together

>
> **Identity:**
> - Use Entra ID for tenant-level identity and Managed Identities for resource access.
> - Plan RBAC roles at management group and subscription scopes.
>
> **Operations:**
> - Use Azure Policy and Azure Blueprints for repeatable landing zone deployment.
> - Set up monitoring and alerting with Log Analytics workspaces.
>
> [!IMPORTANT]
> For AI workloads, set up dedicated Log Analytics workspaces that collect comprehensive telemetry from both infrastructure components and AI services. This is crucial for end-to-end monitoring and AI-specific operational insights.
