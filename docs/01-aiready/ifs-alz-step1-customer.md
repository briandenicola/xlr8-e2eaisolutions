# Step 1: Customer Context

This section is part of the **IFS AI Ready Challenge**. Here, you’ll analyze the customer’s business drivers, objectives, and success metrics to inform your Azure AI platform design.

---

## Objective

Understand IFS’s motivations for adopting Azure AI, their core business objectives, and how success will be measured.

---

## Activities

- Review the [Innovate Financial Services Customer Story](../ifs-customer-story.md).
- As a team, discuss and answer the following:

  1. **Why does IFS want to use Azure for AI, and what are their primary use cases?**  
     *Hint: Consider market pressures, strategic goals, and financial service applications mentioned.*

  2. **What are IFS’s core business objectives driving this transformation?**  
     *Hint: Focus on outcomes related to fraud, customer experience, costs, and innovation speed.*

  3. **How will IFS measure the success of this initiative?**  
     *Hint: Identify specific metrics and KPIs from the story.*

## Guidance

> **Tip:** The customer story is intentionally high-level. Extract the key business drivers and objectives that will inform your design decisions.  
> Consider these questions to help draft a mission statement:
> - Why are they exploring Azure and AI? Where do they want to be in the future?
> - What are their mandatory and nice-to-have objectives?
> - What is your "definition of done"?
> - What are the key metrics and KPIs for success?

**Example Mission Statement:**  
*"IFS will leverage Azure and AI to transform their financial services, enhancing customer experience and operational efficiency while ensuring compliance and security. Their goal is to innovate rapidly, reduce costs, and deliver high-quality services that meet the evolving needs of their customers."*

## Success Criteria

By the end of this step, you should be able to:

- List **at least three** distinct business drivers motivating IFS’s AI adoption (with references to the customer story).
- List **at least two** specific AI use cases IFS intends to implement.
- List **at least three** measurable success metrics or KPIs (e.g., target reduction %, satisfaction score increase).
- Draft a concise mission statement (1–2 sentences) summarizing IFS’s AI transformation goals.
