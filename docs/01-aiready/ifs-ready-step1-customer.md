# Step 1: AI Strategy & Plan

[Home](../../index.md) > [AI Ready Challenge](../../ai-ready-challenge.md) > [Step 1 - AI Strategy & Plan](./ifs-ready-step1-customer.md)

- [Next: Step 2 – Requirements ➡️](./ifs-ready-step2-requirements.md)

This section is part of the **IFS AI Ready Challenge**. Here you'll define business outcomes, identify AI use cases, and plan the AI adoption phases (Strategy & Plan).

## Why Strategic Planning is Critical

**Proper AI strategy is the foundation of successful AI transformation.** Organizations that skip strategic planning face:

- **87% project failure rate** without clear business alignment
- **4-6x higher costs** from reactive implementation and rework
- **Misaligned AI investments** that don't deliver business value
- **Stakeholder resistance** due to unclear value proposition
- **Compliance and ethical risks** from unplanned AI deployment

### Strategic Success Framework

| Success Factor | With Structured Strategy | Without Strategic Planning |
|----------------|-------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Business Alignment** | Clear ROI and value delivery | Technology-driven initiatives with unclear value |
| **Stakeholder Buy-in** | Unified vision and commitment | Fragmented support and resistance |
| **Resource Allocation** | Prioritized, efficient investment | Scattered resources, competing priorities |
| **Risk Management** | Proactive identification and mitigation | Reactive firefighting and compliance issues |
| **Success Measurement** | Clear metrics and tracking | Ambiguous outcomes and accountability |

## Prerequisites

Before starting this step, gather:

- **Key stakeholders** (1-2 hour workshop session)
- **Basic business context** (current goals, major challenges)
- **Simple current state overview** (what technology exists today)
- **Understanding of IFS priorities** (what matters most to leadership)
- **Executive alignment** (sponsor understands the goal)

## Objective

Define IFS’s AI strategy by identifying key business outcomes, selecting high-impact AI use cases, and establishing success metrics.

---

## Activities

- Review the [Innovate Financial Services Customer Story](../ifs-customer-story.md).
- As a team:
  1. List **Top 3 Business Outcomes** for IFS’s AI adoption (e.g., fraud reduction, customer experience, cost optimization).
  2. Identify **Key AI Use Cases** that deliver those outcomes.
  3. Map each use case to CAF AI phases **Strategy** and **Plan** activities.  4. Define **Success Metrics** and KPIs to measure AI impact.

## Guidance

> **Reference:** [CAF AI Strategy and Plan](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/scenarios/ai/strategy)
>
> - Focus on outcomes: what business value will AI deliver?
> - Prioritize use cases by feasibility, impact, and alignment to IFS goals.
> - Ensure metrics are measurable (e.g., % reduction, CPS improvement).
> - Take into consideration risk management, compliance, and responsible AI principles.
> - Call out internal and external use cases, and how they align with IFS’s strategic goals.

**Example Use Case Table:**

| Business Outcome       | AI Use Case              | CAF Phase     | Success Metric              |
|------------------------|--------------------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| Reduce fraudulent loans| Anomaly detection model  | Strategy, Plan| 10% fraud drop<br>False-positive <5% |
| Improve customer NPS   | Personalized chatbot     | Strategy, Plan| +15 NPS points |
