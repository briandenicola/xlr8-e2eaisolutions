# Step 1: AI Strategy & Plan

This section is part of the **IFS AI Ready Challenge**. Here you’ll define business outcomes, identify AI use cases, and plan the AI adoption phases (Strategy & Plan).

---

## Objective

Define IFS’s AI strategy by identifying key business outcomes, selecting high-impact AI use cases, and establishing success metrics.

---

## Activities

- Review the [Innovate Financial Services Customer Story](../ifs-customer-story.md).
- As a team:
  1. List **Top 3 Business Outcomes** for IFS’s AI adoption (e.g., fraud reduction, customer experience, cost optimization).
  2. Identify **Key AI Use Cases** that deliver those outcomes.
  3. Map each use case to CAF AI phases **Strategy** and **Plan** activities.
  4. Define **Success Metrics** and KPIs to measure AI impact.

---

## Guidance

> **Reference:** [CAF AI Strategy and Plan](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/scenarios/ai/strategy)
>
> - Focus on outcomes: what business value will AI deliver?
> - Prioritize use cases by feasibility, impact, and alignment to IFS goals.
> - Ensure metrics are measurable (e.g., % reduction, CPS improvement).

**Example Use Case Table:**

| Business Outcome       | AI Use Case              | CAF Phase     | Success Metric              |
|------------------------|--------------------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| Reduce fraudulent loans| Anomaly detection model  | Strategy, Plan| <ul><li>10% fraud drop</li><li>False-positive <5%</li></ul>|
| Improve customer NPS   | Personalized chatbot      | Strategy, Plan| <ul><li>+15 NPS points</li></ul>|

## Success Criteria

By the end of this step, you should have:
- Defined **3 business outcomes** with clear descriptions
