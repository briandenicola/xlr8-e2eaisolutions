# AI Ready Challenge Overview

Welcome to the **IFS AI Ready Challenge**. You'll help customers safely adopt Azure for AI by following the [Cloud Adoption Framework for AI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/scenarios/ai/) process and proven Azure Well-Architected Framework (WAF) patterns.

---

## Why This Challenge Is Essential

**Following a structured AI adoption methodology is not optional—it's critical for success.** Organizations that skip foundational steps face:

- **70% higher project failure rates** without proper AI governance
- **3-5x cost overruns** from reactive security and compliance fixes
- **Regulatory penalties** from ungoverned AI implementations
- **Shadow AI proliferation** creating ungoverned, high-risk deployments
- **Technical debt accumulation** requiring expensive platform rebuilds

### Business Impact of Structured AI Adoption

| Success Factor | With CAF AI Methodology | Without Structured Approach |
|----------------|-------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Project Success Rate** | 85% meet business objectives | 30% deliver expected value |
| **Time to Production** | 40% faster with reusable patterns | Extended timelines, rework |
| **Compliance Readiness** | Built-in governance controls | Reactive, expensive retrofitting |
| **Cost Management** | Predictable, optimized spending | Budget overruns, waste |
| **Risk Mitigation** | Proactive controls, monitoring | Reactive firefighting |

---

## CAF AI Adoption Phases

This challenge maps to the Cloud Adoption Framework for AI phases:

1. **Strategy** – Define business outcomes, AI use cases, and success metrics
2. **Plan** – Capture technical, compliance, and responsible AI requirements
3. **Ready** – Build an AI Ready platform foundation on Azure
4. **Govern** – Apply policies and guardrails (AI governance)
5. **Manage** – Implement monitoring, operations, and risk detection
6. **Secure** – Enforce security controls and data protection

## Quick Strategy Checklist

Before you start, identify:

- Top 3 business outcomes for IFS’s AI adoption
- Key AI use cases that align to those outcomes
- Success metrics to measure AI impact
- Stakeholder personas and required capabilities

---

## Challenge Objectives

- Prioritize AI use cases based on business outcomes
- Select and justify Azure AI services and solutions
- Document customer requirements: business, technical, compliance, responsible AI
- Design a trustworthy AI platform and operational processes
- Integrate governance, management, and security controls
- Present and justify your end-to-end solution

## Team Readiness Requirements

**All key stakeholders must participate** for successful AI adoption:

| Role | Participation Level | Key Responsibilities | Success Criteria |
|------|-------------------|---------------------|------------------|
| **Business Sponsor** | Full engagement | Outcome definition, success criteria, funding decisions | Clear ROI targets, strategic alignment |
| **Technical Lead** | Full engagement | Architecture decisions, integration planning | Technical feasibility validation |
| **Security Lead** | Active participation | Compliance validation, risk assessment | Security controls approval |
| **Data Lead** | Active participation | Data strategy, governance, quality | Data readiness validation |
| **Operations Lead** | Consultation | Operational model, monitoring, support | Operational readiness plan |

## Challenge Structure

This challenge is divided into four steps:

1. [Step 1: AI Strategy & Plan](./ifs-ready-step1-customer.md) – Define business outcomes, AI use cases, requirements, and plan for adoption
2. [Step 2: Requirements](./ifs-ready-step2-requirements.md) – Detail business, technical, compliance, and responsible AI requirements
3. [Step 3: AI Solution Design](./ifs-ready-step3-foundations.md) – Architect AI workloads and platform, applying governance and security controls
4. [Step 4: Present & Justify](./ifs-ready-step4-present.md) – Share design, decisions, and alignment to CAF and WAF principles

---

## How to Use This Challenge

- Work as a team through each step in order 1–4
- Use the activities and whiteboard prompts to guide discussions
- Reference the [Azure Best Practices](../05-azure-best-practices/) and the CAF AI checklists for guidance
- Document findings, designs, and decisions as you progress
