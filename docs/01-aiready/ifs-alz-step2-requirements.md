# Step 2: Requirements

This section is part of the **IFS AI Ready Challenge**. Here, you’ll identify and document the business and technical requirements that will shape your Azure AI platform design.

---

## Objective

Capture all critical requirements—business, technical, security, compliance, and operational—that must be addressed in your solution.

---

## Activities

- Review your findings from Step 1 (Customer Context).
- As a team, discuss and document:
  1. **Business Requirements:** What must the solution achieve for IFS to consider it a success? (e.g., regulatory compliance, customer experience, cost targets)
  2. **Technical Requirements:** What are the key technical needs? (e.g., scalability, integration, data residency, performance)
  3. **Security & Compliance:** What security, privacy, and compliance standards must be met? (e.g., GDPR, SOC2, data encryption)
  4. **Operational Requirements:** What are the support, monitoring, and management needs?

---

## Guidance

> **Best Practice:** Reference the [Azure Best Practices](../05-azure-best-practices/) for security, governance, and operational recommendations.
> 
> - Use bullet points for clarity.
> - Prioritize requirements as "Must Have" or "Nice to Have".
> - Consider both current and future needs.

**Example Table:**

| Requirement Type | Description | Priority |
|------------------|-------------|----------|
| Business         | Meet GDPR compliance for all customer data | Must Have |
| Technical        | Integrate with existing CRM system         | Must Have |
| Security         | All data encrypted at rest and in transit  | Must Have |
| Operational      | 24/7 monitoring and alerting               | Nice to Have |

---

## Success Criteria

By the end of this step, you should have:
- A documented list of business, technical, security, and operational requirements
- Clear priorities for each requirement
- Alignment across the team on what the solution must deliver
