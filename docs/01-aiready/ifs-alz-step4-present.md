# Step 4: Present & Justify

This section is part of the **IFS AI Ready Challenge**. Here, you’ll present and validate your AI solution design, demonstrating alignment to CAF Govern & Manage phases and Azure WAF pillars.

---

## Objective

Communicate your design clearly, explain your choices, and demonstrate how your solution meets IFS’s business and technical requirements.

---

## Activities

- Prepare a **5–10 minute** presentation covering:
  1. **AI Strategy & Plan Recap:** Summarize business outcomes, use cases, and metrics.
  2. **Requirements & Plan:** Highlight key requirements and WAF mappings.
  3. **Solution Design:** Present your architecture diagram and key AI workloads.
  4. **Governance & Management:** Explain policies, monitoring plan, and responsible AI controls.
  5. **Justification:** Show how your design meets CAF phases (Govern, Manage, Secure) and WAF pillars.
  6. **Q&A:** Address feedback and questions.

## Guidance

> **Reference:**
> - [CAF AI Govern phase](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/scenarios/ai/governance)
> - [CAF AI Manage phase](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/scenarios/ai/operations)
>
> - Use visuals and a slide template that maps sections to CAF phases and WAF pillars.
> - Include responsible AI controls (content safety, bias mitigation, privacy) and operational plans.
